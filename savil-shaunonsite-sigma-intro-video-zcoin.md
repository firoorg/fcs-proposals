#Proposal
I reached out to ShaunonSite who does video and worked with other blockchain companies out of Korea to
propose doing a Sigma protocol video for zcoin. In there telegram chat the idea of breaking down these 
in depth topics to be digested in short "Did you know video?" would be good to teach new comers and just
keep good PR content out there. I hope to make this a series of videos to visualize the privacy components
of Zcoin in an easy way.

The script and story boards will be completed by myself and ShaunonSite will obtain assets and complete the 
editing. We started this process late November last year and we proposed a timeline of two months. The script
was finalized in November and several drafts of the video were completed in December. The voice actor has provided
the voice and music was obtained and added in mid January.
