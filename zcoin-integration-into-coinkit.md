Dear Zcoin Community,

we are the team of the company Blockcurators GmbH from Germany and are seeking funds to integrate Zcoin into our CoinKit.

We offer a tipbot as a service with support for different communication platforms.
As soon as the integration is active, everyone can use the tipbot on twitter, discord, slack or telegram giving more exposure and visibility to Zcoin.

In contrast to many other common tipbots, all of our transactions are on the blockchain (on-chain tipping) and our integration offers a variety of features. CoinKit directly uses the Blockchain technology and doesnt rely on databases for tipping as most tipbots do.

To view a demonstration of the many features which are available today, please visit our website https://coinkit.de/
We have already successfully integrated other crypto currencies like Binance Coin, Qtum, Digibyte, Nexus, Feathercoin, Bittube, Tezos or Trezarcoin and received only positive feedback so far.

Our Key advantages are:

- Support for many different Plattforms ( Slack, Discord, Telegram, Twitter )
- CoinKit as SMM Tool for Twitter with monetized Tweets and automated Giveaways
- Insurance on the Coins up to the proposal amount in USD, backed by a German insurance company
- Direct Support and Developer Contact
- Continuous Development: Every hour of Development work benefits every Member of CoinKit

We are growing rapidly thus you can expect rapid feature grow within the next years

It’s a core Product not a Side Project so it won’t be abandoned anytime soon
Audit is possible: You can get a list of all Accounts and a confirmation that the coins are still there any time
Support for unlimited Users and Installations
Extensive Documentation at our Wiki ( https://wiki.coinkit.de ) and with !tiphelp within CoinKit DMs on each social platform
