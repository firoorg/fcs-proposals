This proposal is for the integration of XZC into Flare Wallet Desktop & Mobile with full swap support & Mobile Masternode Management.

The XZC Masternode Management is a custom developed solution specifically for ProReg masternodes (deterministic nodes). Being able to run Znodes from Flare mobile allows for users to set their collateral in their mobile wallet, and activate their masternode as well (the actual masternode server needs to be set up individually or using a third party service).

Masternode rewards also are received directly in your wallet. This is a fully non-custodial solution, you retain your keys and privacy 100% of the time.
